# Estimating Pi Using Monte-Carlo Methods in C++

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to practice (pseudo-)random number generation and Monte-Carlo methods in C++.
The aim is to arrive at an approximation for $`\pi`$.

The ratio of the area of a square of side length $`2`$, centred on the origin, $`(0, 0)`$, and the unit circle likewise
centred on the origin, may be denoted

  ```math
  \displaystyle\pi r ^2
  ```
